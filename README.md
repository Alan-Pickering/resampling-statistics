# resampling-statistics
Here are a few scripts in Matlab which illustrate resampling apporaches to statistical inference.
The scripts in Matlab are heavily commented and easy to follow. They can just be run at the command prompt.
They use specific datasets but can easily be adapted to read in alternative datasets.
The xxxxxx.txt scripts are equivalent scripts written in the free software statistics101.
This software is very easy to use and has been writen to run resampling stats.
It can be downloaded from here:-

All these scripts accompany the You Tube lectures that can be viewed here:
